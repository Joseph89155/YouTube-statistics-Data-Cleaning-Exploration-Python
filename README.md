# 📺 YouTube Statistics – Data Cleaning & Exploration

## 🎯 Project Objective
To clean and explore YouTube video statistics data in order to identify key patterns behind video popularity, viewer engagement, and category performance.

## 📌 Key Questions (KPIs)
- 📈 Which videos and channels perform best based on views, likes, and comments?
- 🎯 What categories dominate the platform in terms of popularity?
- 🧮 Is there a correlation between likes and views?
- ⏱️ Do upload timing or other metadata affect video performance?
- 🔄 What data cleaning steps improve analysis reliability?

## ⚙️ Process
1. 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and corrected data types.
2. 🏷️ **Feature Engineering**: Created new metrics (e.g., like ratio) to aid in insights.
3. 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzed trends in engagement, categories, and video metrics.
4. 🧰 **Tools Used**:
   - Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
   - Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Project Insight
- 🚀 Videos in the entertainment and music categories tend to outperform others.
- 👍 A strong positive correlation exists between views and likes.
- 📅 Upload frequency and high comment counts often signal viral potential.
- 🧹 Proper data cleaning was crucial for identifying genuine performance trends.

## ✅ Final Conclusion
This project offers a foundation for understanding digital content performance using YouTube data. Clean, well-analyzed datasets enable better content strategy, marketing decisions, and viewer targeting through data-driven insights.
